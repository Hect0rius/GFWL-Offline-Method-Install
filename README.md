# GFWL-Offline-Method-Install
 Games For Windows Live Final (Original) Offline Install Method as install cannot download the files from ms as some where missing online.

#Windows 10
Simply Launch "gfwlivesetup.exe" await it crashing, thats ok, as we will play a bit of trickery and insert the files into the cache so next time it is ran it will install correctly.

So once launched, locate the following folder :

"C:\Users\USER_ACCOUNT\AppData\Local\Microsoft\GFWLive\Downloads\"

Change "USER_ACCOUNT" with your windows username, then copy all the files in the Downloads folder of this release and paste them into the above directory.

Once You have copied the files, relaunch the "gfwlivesetup.exe" again, then it will install the files, it will complete now :)

I cannot help you with a key for gfwl, but I tested the following games with this and they have full functionality :

Gears of War 1 PC
